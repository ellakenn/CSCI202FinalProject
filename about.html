          <p class = "display-4" id="firstLine">Since I was little I have always been passionate about capturing the little moments in life.</p>

          <p>I believe that we should make the most of every single day, take things less serious, and live life to the
          fullest. After all, you only have one life, why not fill it with everything in your wildest dreams? For me,
          it always was a dream of mine to be a photographer, but for some reason it felt so unattainable for me. Then
          I asked myself, “Why not? What is stopping you?”, and I realized nothing was stopping me but myself. Photography
          has allowed me to tap into all of my passions, and combine them into one. For me, it is not just about taking
          a cool picture, I strive to make genuine connections with others, and leave sessions feeling as though I have
          made a friend.</p>

        <p>Connection is what I value above all else. Since I picked up my first camera at 13, I have been fascinated with
          capturing the connection between others, and empowering people to feel most like themselves. Photography has a
          profound impact on so many people. A singular photo can take you back to the moment you got engaged, celebrated
          one of your accomplishments, or your first dance with your partner to your favorite song.</p>

        <p>I am passionate about all the little things. The reflection of a dreamy pink sunset on the water, the way  trees
          slowly sway in the breeze, the smell of a late night windows down summer drive, the way someone brushes the hair
          out of your face, the moon, the feeling of holding hands for the first time, gently rubbing your thumb over your
          partner's hand, the smallest kiss on the cheek… everything. I want you to look at your photos and remember the
          little moments.</p>

        <p>My goal is for us to inspire each other, me giving you space and time to dedicate to your love or accomplishment,
          and you telling me your story - allowing us to create something beautiful together. I want you to walk away from
          this experience feeling empowered, full of love, happiness and good energy. I want you to look back at the experience
          and photos and feel something.</p>
